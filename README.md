# Tank
Built a tank object formed from scaled cubes and cylinders
For this project, I organized everything within the tank constructor. As for the parts themselves, I used the cube vertices from our previous projects and just scaled them to fit my purposes. Thus, the hull, the turret, and the muzzle all share the same vertices and color vertices. I had to create new vertices for my wheels because I was a bit ambitious and I wanted circular wheels. I am pretty proud of how they turned out. I even messed with the colors to give the wheels an X pattern. All of the tank parts share the same view and projection matrix and have different model matrices that are named after their respective parts. WASD controls the tank’s movement, while the up and down arrow keys adjust the muzzle angle. Meanwhile, the left and right arrow keys adjust the rotation of the turret/muzzle. Unfortunately, I had a few bugs in my program. I was unable to change the axis of rotation for the muzzle and turret. Therefore, if I try turning the turret, it won’t stay on the tank body, as it will still rotate around the y-axis of the origin, even if the rest of the tank isn’t there. I tried to apply a reverse rotation before applying a new rotation, like I did with the wheels, but it didn’t work so I got rid of that code. All in all, this was a fun project.
